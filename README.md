# LangChain-AutoGPT-Recipe-Generation-Streamlit-App


AutoGPT Recipe Generator is a Python application that uses the AutoGPT language model from OpenAI to generate recipes based on a list of ingredients provided by the user. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

To use the application, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system and the required packages (streamlit, langchain) installed. You also need to obtain an API key from OpenAI and add it to the apikey.py file in the project directory.

Once everything is set up, you can run the application, and it will present a web interface where you can enter a list of ingredients. After clicking the "Generate Recipe" button, the application will use the AutoGPT model to generate a recipe based on the provided ingredients. The generated recipe will be displayed on the screen.

In case of any errors during the generation process, an error message will be shown.
